I am currently a 1st year Ph.D student at [CS Department in University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/).
I previously finished my M.S here as well.
I am advised by [Prof. David Jacobs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/).
My current research interests are focused on understanding and developing defenses against adversarial examples for machine learning systems.
Previously, I also worked on visual recognition problems such as object detection and instance segmentation.
