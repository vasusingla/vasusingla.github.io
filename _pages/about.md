I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D student at [CS Department in University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I previously finished my M.S here as well. 
I am advised by [Prof. Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) and [Prof. David Jacobs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/).

My research interests span multiple areas. Recently my work has been focused on generative models, security and attribution of machine learning systems.


Previously, I have also worked on visual recognition problems such as object detection and instance segmentation.
