I am currently a second year grad student and will be continuing my Ph.D at [CS Department in University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. David Jacobs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/). My current research interests are focused on understanding and developing defenses against adversarial examples for machine learning systems. Previously, I also worked on visual recognition problems such as object detection and instance segmentation.
