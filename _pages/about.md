I'm on the job market! Please reach out, if you have any opporunity, you think I'd be a good fit for. 
I am currently a 4th year Ph.D at [CS Department in University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I previously spent 2 years as a Master student here. 
I am advised by [Prof. Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) and [Prof. David Jacobs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/). 
My research interests span multiple areas, such as multimodal learning, robustness, and security of AI systems.


Previously, I have also worked on visual recognition problems such as object detection and instance segmentation.
